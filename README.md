## END TO END ML PROJECT 

Here's a clean, professional `README.md` for your **ML End-to-End Deployment Project** (the one hosted at [https://github.com/adityaxgoswami/ml-project](https://github.com/adityaxgoswami/ml-project)):

---

## 🤖 ML Deployment Pipeline – End-to-End Machine Learning Web App

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that covers everything from data preprocessing to model deployment. The trained model is wrapped in a Flask API and deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for real-time prediction access via a web interface.

---

### 🚀 Features

- End-to-End ML workflow: preprocessing → training → deployment
- Web interface for user input & predictions
- Flask backend serving the model
- Deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Clean modular code structure for easy understanding

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (or integrated template)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Deployment**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Others**: Pandas, NumPy, Pickle
